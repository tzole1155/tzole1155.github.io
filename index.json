AR has the potential to make the communication processes highly effective and provide a better experience for the customer. Current AR authoring solutions are quite complex and require manually creating scenes or rely on objects prepared with even more complex applications (e.g. CAD). ATLANTIS will fill this gap in authoring AR experiences by creating a faithful textured geometric (3D) representation from images of the real scene and identifying and segmenting objects in the scene and associating them with the 3D representation.\nThe ATLANTIS authoring tool will enable the fusion of 3D CG elements with real scenes in a guided manner using artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate more productive and effective content creation. This allows automatic alignment of inserted objects and automated layout generation, enabling the user to interact with different options without the need to manually author each of them. In addition, ATLANTIS will innovate beyond traditional AR authoring by complementing the capacity with Diminished Reality (DR) authoring capabilities, enabling the removal and replacement of real objects in the scene allowing to visualise also heavy changes to an environment. The innovations of ATLANTIS will be integrated in an existing solution for interior design and retailing, and validated with professionals and customers.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"c9a0d1794cff27bfafd0699727371102","permalink":"https://tzole1155.github.io/project/atlantis/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/atlantis/","section":"project","summary":"Authoring tool for indoor augmented and diminished reality experiences.","tags":["H2020","XR"],"title":"ATLANTIS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax.
